- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was a literal bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist, found a moth trapped inside the Harvard Mark II computer.
This moth caused a malfunction in the system, and Grace Hopper famously removed the moth and taped it to the computer's logbook with the annotation "First actual case of bug being found."
This incident led to the term "debugging" being used to describe the process of fixing errors in computer hardware or software.
It's a humorous reminder of the origins of computer troubleshooting and the ingenuity of early computer scientists.
